# Internet Testor
You can find the website [here](https://polmrt.github.io/test_internet/) or you can download it and just open the `index.html`


This little website aims to help you to troubleshot your internet. When you're disconnected you'll see it. Also there is a log system in the browser console. You can open the Browser Console in one of two ways: from the menu: select "Browser Console" from the Web Developer submenu in the Firefox Menu (or Tools menu if you display the menu bar or are on macOS) from the keyboard: press Ctrl+Shift+K (or `⎇ ⌘ K` on a Mac).
